# lidar-navigation-car
Autonomous self-driving car using ESP32 and TF-Luna LiDAR with real-time web-based distance monitoring and manual control dashboard via Chart.js.
🚗 Self-Driving Car using ESP32 and LiDAR
This project demonstrates a smart autonomous car built using an ESP32 microcontroller and a TF-Luna LiDAR sensor. The car is capable of detecting obstacles, making navigation decisions, and can also be controlled manually via a Wi-Fi-based web interface. A real-time distance graph is plotted using Chart.js for live monitoring.
🔧 Features
•	📡 TF-Luna LiDAR for real-time obstacle detection (up to 30 meters)
•	🧠 Autonomous Mode with dynamic path planning using servo-based directional scanning
•	🔹 Manual Mode via onboard web server (hosted by ESP32)
•	📊 Live Distance Chart on the web dashboard using Chart.js
•	📶 Wi-Fi AP Mode – No external router or internet required
•	⚙️ Controls 4 DC motors with L298N motor driver
